# Open-Source Intelligence and Passive Reconnaissance

## Basic principles of reconnaissance

**Reconnaissance**, or **recon**, is the **first step** of the **kill chain** when conducting a penetration test or an attack against a data target

Using **passive reconnaissance** and limiting the amount of data collected **minimizes the risk** of being **detected by the target**

### Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)

This is the art of **collecting information** from **public sources**, particularly through the **Internet**

```
