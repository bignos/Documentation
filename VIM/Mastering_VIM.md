"{ch}       Named register[a-z], use like user clipboard
"{CH}       Named register, but when you use uppercase character, you append the register(Accumulator)
```

## -[ Marker ]-

```
m{ch}       Mark the current position with {ch}
'{ch}       Goto the first character of the line marked by {ch}

Call the sequence with **@{nrg}**.  
You can repeat the last macro with **@@**.

```
q{nrg}          Start macro recording for named register {nrg}
q               Stop macro recording
@{nrg}          Execute macro from named register {nrg}

```
