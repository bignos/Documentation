Cloud Foundry The Cloud-Native Platform
=======================================


## 1. Introduction
- To thrive in this world, you need the ability to deliver software quickly, repeatedly, and with regular feedback.
- Cloud Foundry is a platform for running applications and services.
- Its purpose is to change the way applications and services are deployed and run by reducing the develop to deployment cycle time.

### The Competitive Advantage
- Market-disrupting companies differ from incumbents because they can repeatedly deliver software,  
    with velocity, through iterative development cycles of short duration.

### The Development-Feedback Cycle
- Any development cycle must include a constant feedback loop from end users for continually refining your product.
- A constant developmentfeedback cycle allows you to  
    try out new ideas, quickly identify failings, acknowledge feedback, rapidly adapt, and repeat.

### Velocity Over Speed
- In every marketplace, speed wins.
- Speed coupled with the development-feedback cycle produces velocity, and velocity is the only way to move both quickly and securely.

### The Critical Challenge
- Cloud-native platforms provide a focal point that centers that change.  
    They make it easier to do the right thing because everything you need to deliver software is already built into a platform.

### Becoming Cloud Native
- Cloud native is a term describing software designed to run and scale reliably and predictably  
    on top of potentially unreliable cloud-based infrastructure.
- Cloud-native applications are purposefully designed to be infrastructure unaware,  
    meaning they are decoupled from infrastructure and free to move as required.
- Becoming cloud native involves three fundamental tenets:
    - Automated Infrastructure Management and Orchestration
    - Platforms
    - The Twelve-Factor App
- Becoming cloud native is an essential step in establishing a timely development-feedback cycle  
    because it helps companies achieve velocity deploying software releases into production.

### Undifferentiated Heavy Lifting
- Most enterprises outside the information technology industry do not generate revenue from selling software;  
    they leverage software to drive value into their core business.
- Examples of undifferentiated heavy lifting include:
    - Provisioning VMs, middleware, and databases
    - Creating and orchestrating containers
    - User management
    - Load balancing and traffic routing
    - Centralized log aggregation
    - Scaling
    - Security auditing
    - Providing fault tolerance and resilience

### Platforms Benefit Developers
- The platform leverages middleware and infrastructure directly, allowing streamlined development through self-service environments.
- Applications can then be bound to a wide set of available backing services that are available on demand.

### Platforms Benefit Operations
- The platform provides responsive IT operations,  
    with full visibility and control over the application life cycle, provisioning, deployment, upgrades, and security patches.

### Platforms Benefit the Business
- The business no longer needs to be constrained by process or organizational silos.
- Cloud-native platforms provide a contractual promise to allow the business to move with velocity and establish the developer-feedback loop.

### Chapter Summary
- Technology is used to achieve a competitive advantage, but technology alone has never been enough.
- The world needs to fundamentally change the way it builds and deploys software  
    in order to succeed in the hugely competitive markets that exist today.
- Cloudnative platforms provide the most compelling way to enable that fundamental shift.


## 2. Adapt or Die
> There are two approaches to handling change: adapt or die vs. same mess for less!
- Businesses today are constantly pressured to adopt the myriad of technical driving forces impacting software development and delivery.  
    These driving forces include:
    - Anything as a service
    - Cloud computing
    - Containers
    - Agile
    - Automation
    - DevOps
    - Microservices
    - Business-capability teams
    - Cloud-native applications

### Anything As A Service
- We have now reached the point where if you are not leveraging compute resources as a service,  
    it is unlikely that you are moving at the pace required to stay competitive.
- If there is a service out there that has been deployed and managed in a repeatable and scalable way,  
    becoming a consumer of that service allows you to focus on software supporting your revenue-generating business.

### Cloud Computing
- Cloud computing is the third incarnation of the platform eras:
    - The first era was the mainframe, which dominated the industry from the 1950s through the early 1980s.
    - Client-server architecture was established as the dominant second platform from the 1980s right up until the second decade of the 21st century.
    - The “as a service” movement in IT has broadly been termed cloud computing, and it defines the third platform era we live in today.
- Cloud computing has been subdivided into “as a service” layers (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc).
- Regardless of the layer, there are three definitive attributes of “as a service”:
    - Elasticity  
        The ability to handle concurrent growth through dynamically scaling the service up and down at speed.
    - On demand  
        The ability to choose when and how to consume the required service.
    - Self-service  
        The ability to directly provision or obtain the required service without time-consuming ticketing.
- This self-service capability is a shift from procuring resources through a ticketing system involving handoffs  
    and delays between developers and operations.
